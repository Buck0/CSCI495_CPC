Code Plagiarism Checker for Systems Analysis

This program is designed to check for plagiarism in the code of students, particularly java code.
Theoretically, the checker should also work against any type of file that would specifically have lines copied from elsewhere such as html or cpp.
However, an English paper would not be a suitable candidate for this program to test.
It is supposed to compare the lines of a student's code to another piece of code or to a local database of previous code.
Its has no GUI so the UI is the terminal.
There is no java code in the implementation of the program, only a single batch file and then cpp code.
All of the java code registered on the code distibution are just fake entries for the database so that the database can have at least one entry per subfolder.
